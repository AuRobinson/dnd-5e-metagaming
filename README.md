_I do not condone metagaming purely to "win". Narrative is more important than deeps._

## What is metagaming?

Metagaming refers to a player utilizing knowledge outside of or not available to the character they're playing in the game. For example, calculating the chance of you hitting a monster depending on specific measurements wouldn't be something that the character would know, only you as the player would.

## Is it fair/ethical to metagame?

It depends. If you're metagaming purely to "win", then I'd lean into a **no**. If you're using it to better understand the world and apply the difficulty into a narrative for your characters then I'd say **yes**.

## Mothod and Conditions

The method in determining the enemie's Armor Class (AC) and your general hit-chance is framed around Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition, but can easily be tweaked to any TTRPG with a dice system. 

_All hail the math rocks_.
