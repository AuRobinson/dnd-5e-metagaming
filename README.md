_I do not condone metagaming purely to "win". Narrative is more important than deeps._

## What is metagaming?

Metagaming refers to a player utilizing knowledge outside of or not available to the character they're playing in the game. For example, calculating the chance of you hitting a monster depending on specific measurements wouldn't be something that the character would know, only you as the player would.

## Is it Fair?

It depends. If you're metagaming purely to "win", then I'd lean into a **no**. If you're using it to better understand the world and apply the difficulty into a narrative for your characters then I'd say **yes**.

## Mothod and Conditions

The method in determining the enemie's Armor Class (AC) and your general hit-chance is framed around Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition (5e), but can easily be tweaked to any TTRPG with a dice system. 

_All hail the math rocks_.

### Finding the Difficulty

There are 2 notable difficulty types in D&D 5th edition. To simplify you can think of this as **attacking** and **defending**.

> The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).

> _D&D Player's Handbook; introduction p. 7_

Within the rules of 5e, players are told the DC of a spell or save, where an enemy or target's AC is not explicitly mentioned.





Finding the Armor Class or Difficulty Class (AC/DC) <!-- it's a funny joke right? --> in 5e is a simple process of noting when you succeed and fail to hit.

If you're able to hit
